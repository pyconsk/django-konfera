Lifecycle of the talk can have multiple stages. Only talks that are marked as *Published* are displayed on the frontend of the application. Rest of the statuses are for organizers information only.

Talk statuses:
* *Call For Proposals* - Submited talk proposal by the speaker. (Default status when submitting via frontend).
* *Draft* - Talk added by admin, details of the talk are not finished, or speaker is not confirmed yet.
* *Approved* - Talk ready to be published, but organizers do not want to display it on the frontend.
* *Published* - Displayed talks on the frontend.
* *Rejected* - Talk proposal did not pass.
* *Withdrawn* - Speaker has to cancel the talk.
