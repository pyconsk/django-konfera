Attendee Check In
=================

1. Create a group in admin, called *Checkin*.
2. Add the users who should be able to access the check-in system to the group.

The users in *Checkin* group can now access the check-in system at `/event_slug/checkin/`.

In the check-in system, you can use the search for either *First name*, *Last name* or *Email*. However, not all at once.
