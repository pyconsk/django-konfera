We are happy with any volunteers involvement in `django-konfera <https://github.com/pyconsk/django-konfera>`_ app. If you would like to help us, there are multiple ways to do so. Depending on your skills and type of work you would like to do (doesnâ€™t have to be development), we encourage you to start with any of the following:

You can help out by spreading the word about `django-konfera <https://github.com/pyconsk/django-konfera>`_ , or joining `mailing list: django-konfera@pycon.sk <https://groups.google.com/a/pycon.sk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/django-konfera>`_ to help others or share your ideas and experiences with people in community.

Update documentation
--------------------

`Github wiki <https://github.com/pyconsk/django-konfera/wiki>`_ is used to guide users and developers the right way. If you don't know how to do something, we probably missed it in our wiki. Documentation is a never ending process so we welcome any improvement suggestions, feel free to create issues in our bug tracker.

If you feel that our documentation needs to be modified or we missed something, feel free to submit PR, or get in touch with us at our `mailing list: django-konfera@pycon.sk <https://groups.google.com/a/pycon.sk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/django-konfera>`_.

If there is something you are missing, and wish to be implemented in `django-konfera <https://github.com/pyconsk/django-konfera>`_, feel free to create an issue and mark it as an enhancement.

Update django-konfera
---------------------

All development is done on `Github <https://github.com/pyconsk/django-konfera>`_. If you decide to work on existing issue, please mention in the issue comment that you are working on it so other people do not work on the same issue. Create your `fork <https://github.com/pyconsk/django-konfera/fork>`_ and in new branch update code. Once you are happy with your changes create `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ and we will review and merge it as soon as we can. To make the life easier please do all your work in a `separate branch <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching>`_ (if there are multiple commits we do `squash merge <https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits>`_), if there is a bug for your change should include the bug number in the branch name and merge request description so they are linked on GitHub. We encourage you to write tests for your code (however this is not required), as we have `continuous integration <https://travis-ci.org/pyconsk/django-konfera>`_ in place. Once you request merge request on github, there will be an automated test run, please make sure everything passes.

Write a test
------------

We realize that there is never too much testing, so you can help us by creating any form of `automated testing <https://travis-ci.org/pyconsk/django-konfera>`_.
